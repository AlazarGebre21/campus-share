## 🔌 API Integration Logic

This frontend communicates with the backend using a centralized **Axios instance** (`src/lib/axios.js`).

- **Request Interceptor:** Automatically attaches the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` to every request if a user is logged in.
- **Response Interceptor:** Global error handling. If the backend returns `401 Unauthorized`, the app automatically clears local storage and redirects the user to `/login`.
